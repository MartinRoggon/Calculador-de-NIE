# Calculador-de-NIE
I have designed a calculater that completes your Spanish NIE with the correct letter at the end using javascript

This is a study for me to understand better the basic funtionality of javascript. 
Since I have not yet the knowledge to pair this with a proper form and input request, in order to use this program do the following:

Open the code and fill in row 17 with either your Spanish NIE (One letter followed by a 7 digit number) or DNI (An 8 digit number). 
Make sure that you fill in type string for NIE and type number for DNI.

The first if clause (lines 22-28) will check if your input is a number or a string and will trigger the appropriate function.

The function for each will console-log the result with your completed DNI or NIE number.
